Model Description       : From the Japanese anime "Super Dimensional
			  Fortress: Macross", or Robotech to American
			  fans, the Regult (Zentraedi Battlepod) is a
			  bipedal enemy unit piloted by a single Zentran, 
			  an alien race of human-like giants.  

Other Info              : This model was created to complement the other
			  Macross models produced by Dan Bickell.  His
			  Macross works include Battroid, Queadluun_Rau,
			  and the fantastic Valkyrie_VF1S/J/A.  By using
			  all these Macross models available in a bot
			  deathmatch, it is the closest thing we have to
			  a Macross TC for Quake II.

Special Thanks to	: Dan Bickell, for all his Macross models.  Had
			  it not been for the availability of those
			  models, this Regult model would not have been
			  produced.

* Epilogue *

Check out the jpeg picture included in this zip file.  It shows all the
models I have ever done for Quake 2.  The red mecha robot in the middle
was my first model, inspired by the D.D. Battlemover from Bubblegum
Crisis.  The one on the left was my second model, a high-poly version
of the Power Loader X4S from Power Dolls.  Finally, my latest release that you have just downloaded is the one on the right.  Screenshot taken
in Famke bot.
